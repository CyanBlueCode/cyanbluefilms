          answer: (
            <>
              Nope — we create the content, not the marketing. To actually get
              new members or exposure, you&apos;ll need to use what we create in
              your own campaigns, socials, or website. We&apos;re the team that
              delivers pro-level videos and photos that sell your gym for you,
              you just need to put it out there.

          question: 'How long does the process take?',
          answer: (
            <>
              The shoot itself usually takes <strong>one day</strong>. The full
              project — planning, filming, and editing — typically runs{' '}
              <strong>3-4 weeks</strong>. We spend time upfront with you to
              understand your goals so everything we create hits the mark.
              You&apos;ll be involved in planning, but we handle all the
              technical work.

        {
          question: 'Will filming disrupt our classes?',
          answer: (
            <>
              Minimal disruption is our goal. Most shoots require{' '}
              <strong>only 2-3 crew members for a single day</strong>. We can
              get most of the content in one extended class of regular members,
              or we can schedule the shoot during off-hours. Your gym keeps
              running while we capture everything we need. This could even be a
              fun experience for your existing students and boost member
              retention.

          question: 'What kind of gear do you use?',

              We use actual{' '}
              <strong>
                cinema cameras, cine lenses, and pro lighting rigs
              </strong>{' '}
              some of the same equipment found on Hollywood sets. It does mean
              we&apos;ll need to setup lights and gear around the gym, but trust
              us, you&apos;ll be glad we did once you see the results.

        {
          question: 'Can I request changes to the edits?',
          answer: (
            <>
              Absolutely. Every project comes with{' '}
              <strong>one free round of revisions</strong>. Need extra cuts,
              social clips, or alternate edits? We can do those too at a simple
              hourly rate.

          question: 'Do you provide photography?',

              Every package includes <strong>10+ high-res 4K images</strong>{' '}
              pulled from the shoot footage. Larger sets of dedicated
              professional photos (30+ megapixels) are also available as an
              upgrade.

        {
          question: "What's included in the base package?",
          answer: (
            <>
              You get:
              <br />- <strong>1 polished hero video</strong> (~1-3 minutes) for
              your website, YouTube, Yelp, Maps, in-gym display, etc
              <br />-{' '}
              <strong>3 social-ready & ad-ready edited sequences</strong>{' '}
              (~10-30 seconds each)
              <br />- <strong>10+ edited images from footage</strong>
              <br />
              You can also re-trim these videos yourself any time for extra
              shorts, posts, or GIFs. So a single shoot can provide{' '}
              <strong>months of high-quality content</strong>.

        {
          question: 'How much does it cost?',
          answer: (
            <>
              Pricing starts at around <strong>$2,750</strong>, depending on
              your gym size, how ambitious the project is, and how much content
              you want. To put it in perspective, that&apos;s roughly equivalent
              to only <strong>one new member&apos;s annual membership</strong>,
              but it&apos;s a one-time investment that continues to pay off as
              potential new members see your gym.
            </>
          ),
        },
        {
          question: 'I need content regularly, can you help with that?',
          answer: (
            <>
              Absolutely. Many gyms find it valuable to schedule ongoing shoots
              or monthly content refreshes to keep their marketing fresh and
              maintain momentum. We offer discounted retainers and can tailor a
              plan that fits your goals, budget, and cadence without disrupting
              your regular operations.
